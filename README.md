Hello Ms.G


This repo contains one file, not like our laravel project.

we will practice some git action:

## First, you need to clone the repo to your computer.
Remember:
every git command start with git ( so if you need more info, just type git into your terminal)

To clone the repo:
1- copy the repo link from upper right green botton.
2- in the terminal, type:
 git clone the_repo_link

Now the repo is copied into you computer

## use your preferred text editor to update this line:

Replace this line with whatever you like (please don't write you Credit card number LOL ðŸ˜œ


After you save this file, you might run "git status" to see if git notice any change on the files.

## now we will add the change to be committed.

git add README.md

## after that we can go ahead and commit the changes.
git commit -m "your comment goes here"

## it the time to send your change to the remote repo.

git push

you are ready for the next mission ðŸ˜Ž Ms.G
